I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Tulsa. I have bachelor degree in Computer 
Science and Information Systems, and master's degree in Software Engineering. I have worked previously in
industry as R&D Software Engineer.

My research interests can be summarized as follows:
* ways to design and think of human-agent teams, e.g., how to allocate tasks?
* developing agents that enable humans and enrich their lives positively
* AI impact, especially on non-English language communities and emerging countries

It is exciting to build a bridge between CS and Social Sciences, e.g. Management, Psychology, and Economics.


I like watching international movies with my family!
